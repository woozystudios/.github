## WoozyStudio

You might be wondering, why does Woozy have an organization, if it already has a GitHub profile with almost the same name? Well, there's an explanation for that. My projects occupy somewhat special dependencies and packages, and in this organization I store those packages, for example, the TypeScript handler I'm using in [Eclipse](https://github.com/woozystudio/Eclipse) project, is in this organization as a public repository, in case you want to use it. It is very useful to have an organization apart from your profile because you can separate your products from your utilities, in this organization there are not so many public repositories, but there are many private ones.
